# pythonPasswordGenerator

This is a basic password manager, with options for both length and disabling repetition of characters.

This is one of the first projects I have completed in python. I followed [this guide](https://pythongeeks.org/python-password-generator/) from [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org). I tried to analyse each line of code and research it if I could not understand it initially.

## My additions from original project
I added a very simple copy to clipboard button using pyperclip to manage the clipboard.
